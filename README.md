# Scrambled Words

This is a web app done in vue js, in which you get wrong random words based on the level you selected and your mission is to find it out and typed it correctly.

> I added few words to each level, you can extend them and add as many you want.

## Project setup

- First download the project.
- Second cd into the project

```
cd "PathToFolder/scrambled-words"
```

- Third run npm run serve

```
npm run serve
```

## Then Enjoy!

# Note:

You should have a project with **Vuejs 2.x** not **3.x**
